  <td> <div style=text-align:center> <p> <span style=color:black> Throughout my childhood, I was a kid who craved nothing shy of perfection. I was a kid who never gave up and pushed myself to the best of my abilities.
  I grew up in a small town on the outskirts of Atlanta where I was raised by the two most loving and caring people on this earth, who I call mom and dad. 
  Though they have successfully raised a healthy family, my parents claim that they were lackluster students throughout their school career.  
  As I went through grade school, my parents always stressed the importance of working hard and “chasing my dreams.” 
  It was around the sixth grade when I actually acknowledged that advice and told myself that I was going to be a man of accomplishments throughout my lifetime.
  From that point on, I began to apply myself in the classroom and embarked on a long journey through the ups and downs of chasing my dreams. </span> </div>
<p> <div style=text-align:center> <span style=color:black> As the years flew by and high school rolled around, I faced great struggle as I attempted to keep my grades up. 
Like most, high school was a busy part of my life, for I had to juggle a schedule consisting of school, work, sports, and of course a suitable social life. 
However, whenever I was feeling stressed or depressed, I always remembered what my parents told me as a kid. 
Before I knew it, my junior year of high school was right around the corner and it was time to start considering potential college choices. 
I entered this process blindfolded, as I had no idea of what path I wanted to take. After a countless number of meetings with my counselor and talks with my parents I began to get frustrated because I was still clueless as to where I was going to college.
 As the latter part of junior year was quickly approaching, I suddenly realized where I wanted to go to school. I had always told myself to be the best that I could be, so this was my time to shine. 
 I decided to apply to <i> The University of Georgia.</i> Through a long process of doubts and skepticism, I patiently waited to hear if I had conquered success. </span> </div>
<p> <div style=text-align:center> <span style=color:black> March 18th, 2015 is a day that I will never forget. It was the day that all my hard work, dedication, and diligence paid off. It was the day that I could finally call myself a Georgia Bulldog.
 Looking back on my childhood really makes me realize how crucial a positive attitude and mindset are. Many say that the path to success is always under construction, but I am proof that success is easily within reach.</span> </div>
